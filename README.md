# AT CS 2019-current

These are all the program/assignments that I did for my AT CS class as a sophomore. 
My teacher, Mr. Cesar used the NATO phonetic alphabet to name assignments, so for those who are confused by the random folder
names, that was intentional. 

### To explain each assignment:
1. Assignment Kilo: Linear Regression using Boston Housing dataset
2. Assignment Mike: Multinomial Logistic Regression using MNIST dataset
3. Assignment November: Decision Trees and K-Nearest Neighbors 
4. Assignment Oscar: Testing with different models and encoders 
5. Assignment Primus: Data Science Project using SF crime dataset
6. Assignment Quebec: RNNs and CNNs 
7. Assignment Secondus: Machine Learning Project using Kuzushiji-MNIST dataset
