# AT CS 2019-current

These are all the program/assignments that I did for my AT CS class as a sophomore. 
My teacher, Mr. Cesar used the NATO phonetic alphabet to name assignments, so for those who are confused by the random folder
names, that was intentional. 

To explain each assignment:
Assignment Kilo: Linear Regression using Boston Housing dataset
Assignment Mike: Multinomial Logistic Regression using MNIST dataset
Assignment November: Decision Trees and K-Nearest Neighbors 
Assignment Oscar: Testing with different models and encoders 
Assignment Primus: Data Science Project using SF crime dataset
Assignment Quebec: RNNs and CNNs 
Assignment Secondus: Machine Learning Project using Kuzushiji-MNIST dataset
